                      ===========================

REQUIREMENTS
============

This demo application provides a port for the LPC54xxx series of processors
from NXP Semiconductors. The port was done using the OM13092 board with the
LPC54608 and the mcuxpresso IDE. To use a FTDI serial converter for USART0,
you have to set jumper JP6 on this board.

The demo is based on the bare-demo.
